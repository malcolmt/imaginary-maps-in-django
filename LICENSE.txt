All code in this package is licensed as below. Although the copyright holders
are different (there is original code by the author, as well as OpenLayers and
YUI code), all are using the standard "new BSD" license (see
http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php) and is the same license
that is used for Django itself.

The only exception is the map graphic created as the base map (which isn't
code). That is licensed under a Creative Commons
